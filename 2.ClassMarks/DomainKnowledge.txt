Q2 was the easiest question, as most students scored full marks.
Some questions had more than 25 students scoring full marks, making them relatively easier.
A significant number of students scored above 6 marks in certain questions.

Features:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding student performance trends.
Visualization: Insights into score distributions.

Technologies Used:Python,Pandas ,Jupyter Notebook
